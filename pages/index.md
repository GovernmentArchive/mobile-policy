## Background

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is accepting public comment on draft guidance to improve the acquisition and management of mobile services and devices. This policy is the third in a series of [category management](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/simplifying-federal-procurement-to-improve-performance-drive-innovation-increase-savings.pdf) policies to drive greater performance, efficiencies, and savings in commonly-purchased information technology goods and services. 

The public comment period has ended. Thank you for your comments. OMB will analyze all feedback submitted during the public comment period and revise the policy as necessary.
~~The proposed guidance is now open for public comment on this page. The public feedback period will be 30 days, closing on April 28, 2016. Following the public comment period, feedback received will be analyzed to help inform the development of any final policy.~~

## Instructions for Public Comment

You may provide feedback in three ways. We ask that you do not submit the same comment more than once.

1. Content suggestions and discussions are welcome via GitHub “issues.” Each issue is a conversation initiated by a member of the public. We encourage you to browse and [participate in discussions](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/issues) in existing issues, or start a new conversation by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/issues/new).

2. Direct changes and line edits to the content may be submitted through a ["pull request"](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) by clicking ["Edit this page"](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/edit/{{ site.branch }}/{{ page.path }}) (if prompted, follow the instructions to “Fork this repository and propose changes”). You do not need to install any software to suggest a change. You can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit a pull request for your changes to be merged into the document. Directions on how to submit a pull request can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Open pull requests for the proposed guidance can be found [here](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/pulls).

3. We are also accepting content suggestions or proposed revisions through emails sent to the OMB Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer at [ofcio@omb.eop.gov](mailto:ofcio@omb.eop.gov). Please note that **all** comments received will be posted publicly [here](https://github.com/whitehouse/mobile-policy/issues/).
