## **Creating Accountability**

**Creating Accountability**

One of the key principals of category management is ensuring accountability for the effectiveness and efficiency of their wireless service contracts.  Therefore covered agencies should appoint a dedicated category lead, with a supporting team, for mobile services.  The official shall report to the agency CIO and is responsible for working closely with the Senior Procurement Executive and Chief Financial Officer to establish and maintain the agency-wide inventory of wireless contracts, identify opportunities for contract consolidation, track savings, make policy recommendations to the CIO, and perform other duties as necessary to meet the requirements of this policy.  Covered agencies shall send the name and contact information to the individuals identified above and to OMB no later than 90 days from the date of this memorandum.  In the event that covered agencies believe that any specific provision of this policy, such as contract renegotiation and ramifications thereof, is counter to agency mission or not in the best interest of the government under the particular circumstances, the category lead and agency CIO shall apply for a waiver from OMB.

Improving the management of mobile service contracts is a critical step in the implementation of FITARA and in improving value to the taxpayers.  The actions described above will reduce duplication, improve pricing, and better leverage the Government's vast buying power.
